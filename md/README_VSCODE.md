Supercharge your Angular development workflow with the Angular Renamer extension for Visual Studio Code. Effortlessly rename components, pipes, directives, and services while maintaining project consistency.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 One-click renaming of Angular elements
- 🧠 Intelligent updates to class names and import paths
- 🚀 Boost productivity and reduce errors
- 🎨 Seamless integration with VS Code's UI

## 🌟 Why Angular Renamer?

Angular projects can become complex, with interconnected components and services. Manually renaming these elements is time-consuming and error-prone. Angular Renamer automates this process, allowing you to focus on what matters most - building amazing Angular applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install the Angular Renamer extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. Open your Angular project in VS Code
3. Right-click on any Angular element you want to rename
4. Select "Rename Angular Element" from the context menu
5. Enter the new name and let Angular Renamer do the rest!

## 💡 How It Works

Angular Renamer uses advanced algorithms to:

1. Identify the type of Angular element (component, service, etc.)
2. Locate all related files (`.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, `.spec.ts`, etc.)
3. Update file names, class names, and import statements
4. Perform a project-wide search to update any references

## 🛠️ Configuration

Customize Angular Renamer to fit your project's needs:

- **File Extensions**: Add or remove file extensions to include in the renaming process
- **Naming Conventions**: Set your preferred naming style for components, services, etc.
- **Excluded Folders**: Specify folders to ignore during the renaming process

## 📊 Performance Impact

Angular Renamer is designed to be lightweight and efficient:

- Minimal CPU usage during idle time
- Quick renaming operations, even for large projects
- Optimized file system operations to reduce disk I/O
